# Belly_Button_Challenge
As part of this challenge an interactive dashboard was developed using ***D3***, ***Plotly*** to explore the **Belly Button Biodiversity** dataset obtained using javascript and later the dataset was jsonified. The url used is: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

For the *jsonfied* data, a *bar* chart was developed for displaying the top 10 *Operation Taxonomic Unit (OTU)* along with there bacterial sample values. Later a *Bubble chart* was also developed to display all the values for a given OTU id's. Both of the plot's were developed using Plotly.

A *Metadata Dataframe* was also developed using *D3* features as part of the challenge. As a final part the plot were updated when a new Bacteria sample was selected.
